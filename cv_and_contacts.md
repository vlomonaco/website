<h3 id="extended-bio" style="margin-bottom:30px">Short Bio</h3>

Vincenzo Lomonaco is a 29 years old **Assistant Professor** at the **University of Pisa, Italy** and _Co-Founding President_ of <a href="https://www.continualai.org/">ContinualAI</a>, a non-profit research organization and the largest open community on _Continual Learning for AI_. 
Currently, He is also a _Co-founder_ and _Board Member_ of <a href="http://AIforPeople.org">AI for People</a>, Director of the <a href="https://www.continualai.org/lab">ContinualAI Lab</a> and a proud member of the <a href=""><em>European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)</em></a>. 

In Pisa, he works within the [Pervasive AI Lab](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) and the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](http://groups.di.unipi.it/groups/ciml/), which is also part of the and the [Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE)](https://claire-ai.org).

Previously, he was a Post-Doc @ University of Bologna (with: [Davide Maltoni]()) where he also obtained his PhD in early 2019 with a dissertation titled <a href="http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/9073/"><em>"Continual Learning with Deep Architectures"</em></a> (on a topic he's been working on for more than 7 years now) which was recognized as one of the top-5 AI dissertation of 2019 by the <a href=""><em>Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence</em></a>.

For more than 5 years he worked as a teaching assistant for the <a href="http://bias.csr.unibo.it/maltoni/ml/">Machine Learning</a> and <a href="http://bias.csr.unibo.it/maltoni/arc/">Computer Architectures</a> courses in the Department of Computer Science of Engineering (DISI) at UniBo. In the past Vincenzo have been a  _Visiting Research Scientist_ at [AI Labs]() in 2020, at [Numenta](https://numenta.com/) (with: [Jeff Hawkins](), [Subutai Ahmad]()) in 2019, at [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/) (with: [David Filliat]()) in 2018 and at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) (with: [Eugenio Culurciello]()) in 2017. Even before, he was a Machine Learning Software Engineer @ <a href="http://www.moistori.com/">iDL in-line Devices</a> and a Master Student @ UniBo.

His main research interest and passion is about **Continual Learning** in all its facets. In particular, I love to study *Continual Learning* under three main lights: *Neuroscience*, *Deep Learning* and *Practical Applications*, all within a *AI Sustainability* developmental framework.
