Hi! :) And welcome to my new website! The new google sites seems great but lacks a lot of flexibility so I decided to switch to Github [Pages][pages] plus [Jekyll][jekyll]. I found it incredibly powerful and flexible even though some people prefer [Pelican][pelican] as static site generator. 

Take a look around and take in mind the site is still under construction! :)

[pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[pelican]: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/
[jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/
