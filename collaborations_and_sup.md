I'm fortunate enough to collaborate with many talented people on my daily research, working within the [Pervasive AI Lab](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) and the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](http://groups.di.unipi.it/groups/ciml/).

However, I like to collaborate as much as I can with other researchers and organizations across the globe. At the moment I'm a external collaborator at the [University of Bologna]() working within the [Alma Mater Research Institute for Human-Centered (Alma-AI)](), mostly with [Davide Maltoni's group](). 

I work with many units and individuals of the [Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE)](https://claire-ai.org), the [European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](), the [Italian Association for Machine Learning](), the [Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence]() and many others.

Last but not least, through the [ContinualAI Research]() consortium, I collaborate with the leading Continual Learning labs worldwide. Please get in touch if you want to start a collaboration around my research interests!
