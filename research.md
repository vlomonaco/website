In this page you will find everything you need to know about my **research interests** and the **work** I'm carrying out in my daily activities as a researcher at Unibo. I'm always looking for collaboration and open for discussion. Fell free to drop me a line at any time! ;-)

<h3 id="interests" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Research Interests</h3>

I have a strong background in Parallel Computing and Data Analytics. My interest has then evolved towards the field of *Artificial Intelligence*, having always been intrigued by the idea of building machines as intelligent as humans. 

I am now fully engaged in the study of deep learning, continual/lifelong learning, knowledge transfer and distillation, artificial synaptic plasticity and their applications.

The long-term goal of my research aims at answering this single question:

***What could make artificial intelligence systems as sustainable (efficient & scalable) and effective as the human brain? And how to implement it algorithmically?***

While the answer to the "what" part of the question is obvious to me and it is *Continual Learning*, the "how" part is the main focus of my research. This mostly means understanding the true nature of biological learning systems that learn continually: by what computational principles they are governed and how the interaction of these principles let to the emergence of intelligent behaviors; and secondly, the design, prototype and experimentation of algorithmic formulations for artificial learning systems.

<h3 id="lines" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Focus Areas</h3>

My research in *Continual Learning* is split in three main focus areas: **Continual Learning in Computational Neuroscience**, **Continual Learning with Deep Architectures** and **Continual Learning for Practical Applications**, all within a **Sustainable AI** developmental framework.

These three different focus areas ensure that my research in continual learning is grounded in *Deep Learning* and *Neuroscience*, while also preserving a certain degree of *practical applicability*. This is important to evaluate the reachable level of robustness and maturity of our algorithmic  proposals, gather new insights, making a tangible impact in the real-world as well as making sure to direct and take responsibility for this change.

<h3 id="activities" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Other Activities</h3>

In the past I've been a reviewer and a PC member for several conferences such as [ISBA 2016](), [ISBA 2017](), [ISBA 2018](), [PIMRC2018](), [CoRL 2017](), [ICANN 2019](), [AAAI 2020](), [ECAI 2020](), [EAIS 2020]() and a reviewer for prestigious journals such as [Elsevier Cognitive Systems Research](), [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine]() and [IEEE Access]().

I have recently organized the [IEEE EAIS 2020]() special session ["New Trends in Continual Learning with Deep Architectures"](https://sites.google.com/view/eais2020/conference/special-sessions/new-trends-in-continual-learning-with-deep-architectures?authuser=0) and the ["CLVision" workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2020/challenge) at [CVPR 2020]().
