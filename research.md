In this page you will find everything you need to know about my **research interests** and the **work** I'm carrying out in my daily activities as a researcher at Unibo. I'm always looking for collaboration and open for discussion. Fell free to drop me a line at any time! ;-)

<a href="#interests"></a>
<h3 id="interests" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Research Interests</h3>

I have a strong background in Parallel Computing and Data Analytics. My interest has then evolved towards the huge field of Artificial Intelligence, having always been intrigued by the idea of building machines with superhuman abilities. I am now fully engaged in the study of deep learning, continual/lifelong learning, knowledge transfer and distillation, artificial synaptic plasticity and their applications.

The long term goal of my research aims to answer the following questions:

* How much **biological learning systems** can inspire us to build better machines and better learning algorithms? What is the **right level of abstraction**? Can recent advances in Neuroscience provide useful insights to better understand what intelligence really is and design smart algorithms accordingly?

* What does it really mean **Unsupervised Learning**? How much is it important for a learning algorithm? Is it the main feature our brain uses to solve almost any new problem it encounters?

* How much **incremental** and **continual learning** philosophies should be embraced? Are them useful to help generalization and construct a sophisticate understanding of the external world?

* How currently models can be scaled and shaped towards a single and flexible **universal learning algorithm**?

<h3 id="projects" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Open Projects</h3>

I'm currently working on the following projects:

* **Continual Learning Algorithms for Deep Architectures**.
  	Learning continually with deep architectures is an hard task. Gradient-based architectures especially suffer from a problem known in litterature as catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge and skills are suddenly erased to make space to the new ones. The main goal of this project is to develop new continual learning techniques for deep architectures, including sophisticated artificial synaptic plasticity and neural knowledge distillation.

* **New Benchmarks and Evaluation Protocols for Continual Learning**.
  	Evaluation of continual learning algorithms is still difficult and unclear nowasays, as classical machine learning metrics and protocols as well as benchmarks are often not enough to compare, evaluate and prototype new continual learning algorithms. The main goal of this project is to create new benchmarks and evaluations schemes that can help researchers work better in this area.

* **Continual Deep Learning Applications**.
  	The main goal of this project is to transfer fundamental research carried out in the context of continual learning to real-world problems. Interesting areas of applications include continuous production systems, internet-of-things, virtual agents, robotics and embedded systems.

In the past I've been a reviewer and a PC member for several conferences such as [ISBA 2016](), [ISBA 2017](), [ISBA 2018](), [PIMRC2018](), [CoRL 2017](), [ICANN 2019](), [AAAI 2020](), [ECAI 2020](), [EAIS 2020]() and a reviewer for prestigious journals such as [Elsevier Cognitive Systems Research](), [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine]() and [IEEE Access]().

I have recently organized the [IEEE EAIS 2020]() special session ["New Trends in Continual Learning with Deep Architectures"](https://sites.google.com/view/eais2020/conference/special-sessions/new-trends-in-continual-learning-with-deep-architectures?authuser=0) and the ["CLVision" workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2020/challenge) at [CVPR 2020]().
